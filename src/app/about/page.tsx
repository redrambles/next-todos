        <p className='my-4'>
          I'm Ann, a musician turned full-stack developer withÂ over 8 years of building web applications and remote teaching
          experience, particularly with folks who are transitioning into the tech field as early-career developers.
        </p>

        <p className='my-4'>
          I also have extensive experience building and maintaining web applications using a variety of stacks. I've recently
          fallen in love with Ruby on Rails, working with a friend on an open-source environment research initiative over the past
          year.
        </p>

        <p className='my-4'>
          I'm looking for an opportunity to push my technical skills to the next level! I am perpetually curious, always seeking
          to learn more and thrive in a team setting. Right now I'm wrapping my mind around Next.js 13. ðŸŽ‰
